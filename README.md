# NOTE:
The Angular features I've used here: interfaces, services, components, event emitter, form modules, pagination module, and httpclient module.
Please pay attention to the fact that upon requesting to API custom loader is created and used. I've used 2 types of subscribing to API response: as promise (async await OR .than()) AND Angular default subscribe functionality. 
For API I've used https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ , which imitates work with posts.
